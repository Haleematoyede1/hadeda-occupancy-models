# Hadeda Occupancy Models

This repository contains the analysis code used to investigate the range expansion
of the Hadeda Ibis (*Bostrychia hagedash*) across South Africa using single-season
occupancy models, dynamic (multi-season) occupancy models, and spatial occupancy
models implemented within the spOccupancy framework.

The code supports data preparation, model fitting, and result generation for the
analyses used in the research project.

## Data availability.

The processed datasets used in this study are archived in the University of Cape Town’s
institutional research data repository, ZivaHub.

This GitHub repository contains **code only** and does not host the data files.
